Here's a fun, detailed guide you can include as part of the documentation or README when pushing this code to Git. I'll break it down with a mix of emojis, simple language, and plenty of detail!

# 📂 Multi-File Format Processor with PySpark 🐍

## 🎉 Introduction
This PySpark script is designed to **load, transform, and process** data from different file formats—**CSV, JSON, and Parquet**—all in a single run! It applies some of Spark's most powerful features to efficiently handle and process data, then saves the results into organized, partitioned folders for each file type. 🗃️

The code also includes caching, partitioning, SQL transformations, and window functions—making it perfect for **data processing pipelines**, **ETL jobs**, or **data analysis tasks**.

## 💡 How it Works

### 🛠️ Steps and Features

1. **Initialize the Spark Session** 🔌  
   We start by setting up a Spark session, which acts as our gateway to all of Spark's capabilities.  
   - Configured to shuffle only 50 partitions for efficiency with smaller datasets.

2. **Load Files Based on Format** 📄  
   The script goes through each file in a specified directory, recognizes the file type (CSV, JSON, or Parquet), and loads it into a Spark DataFrame.  
   - **Regex patterns** are used to match file types, making the script **flexible and easy to expand** to other formats if needed.

3. **Apply Transformations** 🔄  
   Each DataFrame goes through several transformations based on its type, including:
   - Adding metadata columns like `source_format` and `processed_at` to keep track of the data origin and processing date.
   - Renaming columns and standardizing text formatting (like changing names to uppercase or lowercase).

4. **SQL Queries for Easy Data Manipulation** 📊  
   The code registers DataFrames as temporary SQL views, allowing us to run SQL queries to:
   - Filter 
   - Categorize data
   - Aggregate information (e.g., average age, count of unique names)
   
5. **Cache the DataFrames** 🗃️  
   Caching stores the data in memory, speeding up any repeated operations on the same DataFrame.

6. **Partition Data for Efficiency** 🚀  
   We write each DataFrame back to disk with partitioning by specific columns (e.g., `is_adult`, `age_category`).  
   - **Partitioning** organizes the data for faster reads and queries, especially useful for large datasets.

7. **Combine DataFrames** ➕  
   All individual DataFrames are then **combined** into a single DataFrame using `unionByName`.  
   - This supports files with **similar but not identical schemas** by allowing missing columns.

8. **Optional Broadcast Join** 🛰️  
   The code includes a commented-out section for a **broadcast join**.
